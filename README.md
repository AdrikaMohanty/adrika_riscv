## What is RISCV?
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture used to develop custom processors for Variety of applications.

## Why RISCV?
+ Open source and free to use
+  One of its kind open source hardware
+  Availability of smaller , energy - efficient and modular options .
+  Customizable ISA

What is TL Verilog?
Transaction level verilog or TL Verilog is an emerging System Verilog that supports a new design methodology, called transaction level design.

The fundamental building blocks for digital logics are logic gates , all in 1's and 0's 
+ Not gate
+ AND Gate
+ OR Gate
+ XOR Gate
+ NAND Gate
+ NOR Gate
+ XNOR Gate


### Combinational circuits 
Circuits dont have any memory , the output of the circuit at any instant of time , depends only on the levels present at input terminals .

### LAB EXERSCISES :
Pythagorean example
