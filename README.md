## What is RISCV?
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture used to develop custom processors for Variety of applications.

## Why RISCV?
+ Open source and free to use
+  One of its kind open source hardware
+  Availability of smaller , energy - efficient and modular options .
+  Customizable ISA

What is TL Verilog?
Transaction level verilog or TL Verilog is an emerging System Verilog that supports a new design methodology, called transaction level design.

The fundamental building blocks for digital logics are logic gates , all in 1's and 0's 
+ Not gate
+ AND Gate
+ OR Gate
+ XOR Gate
+ NAND Gate
+ NOR Gate
+ XNOR Gate


### Combinational circuits 
Circuits dont have any memory , the output of the circuit at any instant of time , depends only on the levels present at input terminals .

### LAB EXERSCISES :
Pythagorean example

### Sequential logic:
A sequential logic introduces a clock .
It has memory 


Let's take an example of Fibiniocci series : 1,1,2,3,5,8,13 and so on . It takes the sum of the previous number and the number before that . This in sequential can be implemented as below , here you will observe new notation ``` >>1 ``` this indicated the previous number as in n-1 and ``` >>2 ``` this indicates the number before the previous number as in n-2.
